# ðŸ¤– jaVIs: ESP32 BLE-Controlled Mecanum Robot with Python GUI

This project is a BLE-based mobile robot built using an ESP32 microcontroller and a mecanum drive system. It supports both **autonomous navigation** and **manual control** via a Python GUI over Bluetooth.

## ðŸ§  Features

### âœ… Robot Firmware (ESP32)
- Mecanum motor drive with PWM control
- BLE GATT Server with custom characteristics
- Ultrasonic obstacle detection (front + top)
- Dual-mode:
  - **Manual Control** via GUI
  - **Autonomous Mode** via distance sensors
- Real-time FreeRTOS task scheduling

### ðŸ’» Python GUI (client.py)
- Cross-platform GUI using Tkinter
- BLE connection via [`bleak`](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)
- Command buttons:
  - Directional: `Forward`, `Backward`, `Left`, `Right`
  - Rotation: `CW`, `CCW`
  - Mode Switch: `Manual Start/Stop`
  - Velocity setting (default: 180)
- Responsive interface using threads
- Log panel for feedback
- **Hold-to-repeat** movement logic for smooth control

## ðŸ›  Requirements

### Hardware
- ESP32 Development Board
- 4 Mecanum Wheels + Motor Driver (PWM capable)
- 2Ã— Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
- 5V Power Supply or Battery Pack

### Software
- [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/)
- Python 3.7+
  - `bleak`, `tkinter`, `asyncio` (included in Python)
- iOS App (optional): Swift app provided for BLE control

## ðŸ§ª Build & Flash (ESP32)

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0
idf.py monitor
```

---

## ðŸ•¹ Running the GUI

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install bleak
```

Then launch:

```bash
python client.py
```

The GUI will:
- Scan for `ESP32-Robot`
- Connect over BLE
- Enable button controls with visual feedback (Red=Active, Green=Success)
